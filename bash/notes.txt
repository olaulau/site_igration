requirements :
- sshpass
- lbzip2

todo :
- cleanup destination ? cleanup source (after test & ask) ?
- optimisation when running directly on source or destination : do not specify shell host, do file modification where the script is running
- option to exclude a folder (maybe a subsite, migrated in a second time with it's own database)
